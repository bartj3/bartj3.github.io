Over the years I tried blogging a couple of times. However for some reason I
never seemed able to get some rhythm in it, to keep blogging. The last article
on this blog is well over a year old. And the day I wrote it I was sure it was
the first of many more to come. The post got some traction on
[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) and I got some great feedback.
However the article was a rant, and rants always seem to get traction, and are
the easiest to write.

Last couple of months I've had the honor to be invited to speak at a couple of
usergroups and conferences, and I got some great feedback. People were
enthoustiastic about what I had to tell them, a surprise to me because I thought
my skills to be pretty mediocre. Turns out that I might be comparing myself with
the wrong people. There'll always be some guy better at Vim, or some guy better
at Ruby, and sadly for me plenty of guys better at skateboarding and
snowboarding... but (this sounds obvious but wasn't to me) as it turns out
there's a lot of people that have different focusses when learning new things.
People I can definately teach some new tricks.

Inspired by [Jennifer Dewalt](http://blog.jenniferdewalt.com/post/62998082815/after-180-websites-im-ready-to-start-the-rest-of-my)
who created 180 websites in 180 days, and [Swizec Teller](http://swizec.com/blog/inspired-by-the-180-websites-i-will-understand-52-academic-papers-in-52-weeks/swizec/6365)
whose plan it is to understand 52 academic papers in 52 weeks I've set my own
goal: I'm not going to do anything daily, that'll drive me crazy but I will try
to blog as often as possible with an absolute minimum of 2 blogs a week. They
don't have to be pagelong stories, they could be glorified tweets, but as a
fulltime developer I learn something new every day and I experience something
weird at least once an hour.

So expect some rants but hopefully mostly tips about vim, tmux, ruby, my
workflow, my workspace, crazy hacks, conferences, weird experiences and more!
