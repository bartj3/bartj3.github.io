Up until not too long ago I barely used the terminal, I used it when absolutely
necessary but whenever it was possible I immediately switch to a GUI for
whatever I was doing. After reading yet another "Why Vim is awesome" blog I
decided to make the switch from Textmate to Vim. And once I was editing in Vim
I noticed that I was more productive by just fullscreening my terminal and
staying in the terminal as much as possible. Without continuously switching
between my mouse and keyboard I got faster and faster at the stuff I do most
of my day: coding and everything related to it. Since then I've been trying to
optimize my work flow as much as possible.

The first step to having a pleasant terminal environment is getting the proper
shell. I've picked [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh). Not
because I think zsh is way better then bash or the few other alternatives,
because I honestly wouldn't know whether it's actually better. But because
oh-my-zsh is crazy simple to install and configure, and instantly gives you
awesome benefits. One of the biggest is the auto completion, especially when
just getting started in terminal it's great when you vaguely remember a command
that you can just press tab and it'll suggest a bunch of commands for you to
use. Another great one is the theming options that come with oh-my-zsh. The
starting theme is awesome on itself, but whenever you have some spare time you
should really try customizing a theme to your own desire.

Installing
Obviously they've got installing instructions
[on their github page](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh), however if
you're a mac user installing oh-my-zsh is just a simple oneliner:
```
curl -L https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/raw/master/tools/install.sh | sh
```

Have fun!
