    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the years I tried blogging a couple of times. However for some reason I
never seemed able to get some rhythm in it, to keep blogging. The last article
on this blog is well over a year old. And the day I wrote it I was sure it was
the first of many more to come. The post got some traction on
<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a> and I got some great feedback.
However the article was a rant, and rants always seem to get traction, and are
the easiest to write.</p>

<p>Last couple of months I&rsquo;ve had the honor to be invited to speak at a couple of
usergroups and conferences, and I got some great feedback. People were
enthoustiastic about what I had to tell them, a surprise to me because I thought
my skills to be pretty mediocre. Turns out that I might be comparing myself with
the wrong people. There&rsquo;ll always be some guy better at Vim, or some guy better
at Ruby, and sadly for me plenty of guys better at skateboarding and
snowboarding&hellip; but (this sounds obvious but wasn&rsquo;t to me) as it turns out
there&rsquo;s a lot of people that have different focusses when learning new things.
People I can definately teach some new tricks.</p>

<p>Inspired by <a href="http://blog.jenniferdewalt.com/post/62998082815/after-180-websites-im-ready-to-start-the-rest-of-my">Jennifer Dewalt</a>
who created 180 websites in 180 days, and <a href="http://swizec.com/blog/inspired-by-the-180-websites-i-will-understand-52-academic-papers-in-52-weeks/swizec/6365">Swizec Teller</a>
whose plan it is to understand 52 academic papers in 52 weeks I&rsquo;ve set my own
goal: I&rsquo;m not going to do anything daily, that&rsquo;ll drive me crazy but I will try
to blog as often as possible with an absolute minimum of 2 blogs a week. They
don&rsquo;t have to be pagelong stories, they could be glorified tweets, but as a
fulltime developer I learn something new every day and I experience something
weird at least once an hour.</p>

<p>So expect some rants but hopefully mostly tips about vim, tmux, ruby, my
workflow, my workspace, crazy hacks, conferences, weird experiences and more!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a rant, with lots of bitching and crying, if you hate those rants, stop reading now.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll need to know about two posts before this will make any sense:</p>

<p>Yesterday the bitching about IE seemed to be worse than normal. I believe it started with the post <a href="https://paydirtapp.com/blog/we-dont-support-ie/">&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t support Internet Explorer, and we&rsquo;re calling that a feature&rdquo;</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/paydirtapp">@Paydirt</a>.
When reading the article i was thinking about the insane amount of time i spend on getting sites to work on IE6 and reading that only 1.63% of their traffic uses IE, it makes sense not to support it.</p>

<p>However later that day i read this post &ldquo;<a href="http://blog.reybango.com/2012/05/08/hey-paydirt-your-site-works-just-fine-in-ie/">Hey Paydirt: Your Site Works Just Fine in IE</a>&rdquo; by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/reybango">@reybango</a>, which shows that the not supporting feature of IE, actually is a feature. A bug would be that they didn&rsquo;t test it, and it doesn&rsquo;t work, but they actually put effort in the not supporting of IE. Which&hellip; in my eyes&hellip; is absolutely insane. They check if the browser is IE and just remove all of the users options, not because it doesn&rsquo;t work in IE, but because they &ldquo;have this feature&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t done html/css frontend development in quite some time so i have absolutely no experience with IE9/10 myself, it was a pleasent surprise reading that most of the new stuff that&rsquo;s supported by chrome and firefox is now supported in IE as well&hellip;</p>

<p>So here&rsquo;s this company actively trying to make the browser experience worse for users with IE, not because it doesn&rsquo;t support certain features but just because it wants to play the &ldquo;IE sucks&rdquo; feeling. What shocked me even more is the amount of comments saying that &ldquo;supporting IE is too much work&rdquo;, not because it still costs the crazy amount of time it used to (ie6), but because they&rsquo;re developing on a Mac.</p>

<p>Testing in IE is too much works&hellip; because they&rsquo;re on a Mac.</p>

<h1>WHAT?</h1>

<p>And it&rsquo;s not just one or two persons saying it, but there&rsquo;s quite some people bitching (yes bitching!) about it.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;One of the reasons I don’t test stuff in IE as much as I’d like is because there’s not a slick way to do it on a Mac.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think Microsoft needs to look at better solutions for allowing Mac developers to test IE.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It’s expensive getting hardware to test on, taking time to test it, making sure you have a windows installation&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To debug in any browser I can do it on a mac (decent dev env) to debug in IE I need a dev environment in windows. Enjoy setting that one up.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>Let me get this straight, you&rsquo;re a frontend developer, you picked a system which makes development easier (or not, not going to start a mac/pc flamewar here). However fact is that probably most of your users use windows, and you can&rsquo;t be bothered to test it on windows?</p>

<h3>You should get another job</h3>

<p>Seriously, if <em>&ldquo;no slick way&rdquo;</em> is a good reason not to test, you should be flipping burgers instead of developing. Your main job is development, not being a hipster.</p>

<p>If i offended some people with this post, i&rsquo;m sorry, it&rsquo;s not personal, just my rant about lazy frontend developers.</p>
